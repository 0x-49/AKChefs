### **File Deletion**
These files are no longer needed as they either duplicate functionality or don't align with the new structure:

1. **client/src/components/landing/use-cases.tsx**
   - Delete: This component is redundant with the new focus on actual success stories and team testimonials.

2. **client/src/components/landing/testimonials.tsx**
   - Delete: This will be merged into the success stories section.

3. **client/src/components/landing/market-intelligence.tsx**
   - Delete: Market intelligence will now be part of the training system section.

4. **client/src/components/landing/training-system.tsx**
   - Delete: This will be simplified and integrated into the "How AK Chefs Works" section.

5. **client/src/components/landing/tech-stack.tsx**
   - Delete: Focus on features instead of tech stack.

6. **client/src/components/landing/partnerships.tsx**
   - Delete: Partnerships will be integrated into the features section.

7. **client/src/components/landing/premium-membership.tsx**
   - Delete: Will be merged into the pricing section.
